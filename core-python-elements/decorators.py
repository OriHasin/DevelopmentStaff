from functools import wraps

""" A decorator in Python is a function that wraps another function to add functionality to it, without modifying
the original functionâ€™s code. Decorators are often used for tasks such as logging, enforcing access control and
authentication, modifying input or output, and measuring performance, among others. 

wrapper():
    Purpose: This inner function (the actual wrapper) is where the additional behavior or functionality is defined. 
    It wraps the original function and can execute code before and after calling it.

decorator(func):
    Purpose: This is the outer function that takes the original function as an argument (often referred to as func). 
    Its main job is to define how the original function will be modified or enhanced.
    
@wraps(func) is a decorator from the functools module in Python that is used to preserve the metadata of the original 
function when creating a wrapper function inside another function (like a decorator). It is essential for maintaining the original function's name, docstring, and other attributes.
