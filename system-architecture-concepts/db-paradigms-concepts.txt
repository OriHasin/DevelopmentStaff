Briefing Document: Database Selection and Architecture Considerations

1. Database Types and Characteristics

- **Relational Databases (SQL):**
  - **Model:** Structured tables with fixed schemas, rows, and columns.
  - **Strengths:** Strong ACID compliance, excellent for complex queries and joins, mature ecosystem.
  - **Use Cases:** Applications needing strict consistency (banking, e-commerce), complex analytical reporting.
  - **Scalability:** Traditionally vertical, modern distributed SQL offers horizontal scaling - CP (CAP Theorem).

- **Key-Value Stores:**
  - **Model:** Simple key-value pairs.
  - **Strengths:** Extremely fast for simple operations, schema-agnostic, easy horizontal scaling.
  - **Use Cases:** Caching (Redis, Memcached), session management, feature toggles.
  - **Scalability:** Horizontal with partitioning, typically AP in CAP theorem.

- **Wide-Column Stores:**
  - **Model:** Rows grouped into column families, dynamic columns per row.
  - **Strengths:** Optimized for write-heavy workloads, efficient range queries, handles sparse data.
  - **Use Cases:** IoT data, time-series databases, real-time analytics.
  - **Scalability:** Horizontally scalable with native sharding and replication.
  - NOTE: each column family (table) defined Primary Key which determines how data is partitioned (or sharded).
          by default, the rows of each PK are sorted by clustering key or by range they have added.
          PK can have muliple rows. all rows for specific PK must have the same columns. (different PKs can have different columns in the column family).
          can't have complex queries comparing to SQL.

- **Document Stores:**
  - **Model:** JSON-like documents with nested, hierarchical data.
  - **Strengths:** Flexible schema, supports ad hoc queries and secondary indexes.
  - **Use Cases:** Content management, e-commerce catalogs, event tracking.
  - **Scalability:** Horizontal scaling with sharding, suitable for both read-heavy and write-heavy loads.

- **Graph Databases:**
  - **Model:** Data represented as nodes and edges with properties.
  - **Strengths:** Designed for relationship-centric data, efficient graph traversal, schema flexibility.
  - **Use Cases:** Social networks, fraud detection, recommendation engines, knowledge graphs.
  - **Scalability:** Challenging but manageable with tools like AWS Neptune, typically CP in CAP theorem.

2. Key Takeaways for Database Selection
- Relational databases excel in structured, transactional use cases; NoSQL options provide flexibility and scalability for modern workloads - can choose to be AP or CP.
- Choose a database based on the nature of your data and access patterns:
  - **SQL:** Complex relationships, strict consistency.
  - **Key-Value:** Simple, ultra-fast lookups and caching.
  - **Wide-Column:** Write-heavy workloads and predictable queries.
  - **Document:** Flexible, nested data with dynamic queries.
  - **Graph:** Complex, relationship-heavy datasets.
- Scalability depends on architecture:
  - SQL is traditionally vertical but can scale horizontally with modern solutions (NewSQL).
  - NoSQL options are natively horizontally scalable.

3. Practical Considerations:
- Exhaust all possibilities with your current database (e.g., tuning, sharding, caching) before migrating.
- Benchmark candidate databases using real-world data and workloads.
- Carefully plan migrations with phased rollouts to mitigate risk.
- Embrace trade-offs: Thereâ€™s no perfect database; each option has strengths and weaknesses.
