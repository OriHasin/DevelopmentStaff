B-tree Index Internal Mechanism in PostgreSQL
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a query is executed in PostgreSQL and involves a B-tree index, the internal mechanism follows these steps:

Query Analysis:
PostgreSQL "query planner" analyzes the query to determine if using an index will improve performance. If the query involves equality (=) or range (<, >, BETWEEN) conditions on indexed columns, the planner considers using the B-tree index.

Navigating the B-tree:
    The B-tree index is structured as a balanced tree with leaf nodes containing pointers to the actual table rows and internal nodes containing keys that guide the search.
    Each internal node stores multiple keys (in sorted order), which allow quick navigation through the tree by following pointers to child nodes, reducing the search space logarithmically.

Index Search:
    The query execution engine uses the index key(s) to navigate through the B-tree from the root to the appropriate leaf node.
    The search stops when the matching key is found in a leaf node, which contains pointers to the actual rows in the table that match the query conditions.

Row Retrieval:
    Once the leaf node is reached, the pointers to the matching table rows are used to quickly fetch the actual data from the table. This avoids a full table scan.

Query Execution:
    PostgreSQL returns the results by directly accessing the table rows identified by the index, significantly speeding up the query execution compared to sequential scans.

Update Handling:
    If the query involves inserts, updates, or deletes that affect indexed columns, the B-tree index must be updated accordingly. For updates, old index entries are removed, and new ones are inserted to reflect the changed data.
    This process ensures that range and equality queries on indexed columns are executed efficiently using the logarithmic time complexity of the B-tree structure.


For small tables, indexing may not provide significant performance gains because the overhead of maintaining the index
can outweigh the benefits of faster lookups. In these cases, a sequential scan might be just as fast or even faster,
as the entire table can be loaded into memory quickly.Indexing on small tables is generally more useful if the table grows or if there are frequent,
complex queries that would benefit from the index.

Partitioning in PostgreSQL
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Partitioning is a database design technique used to divide large tables into smaller, more manageable parts called partitions.
Although these partitions are stored as separate physical objects in the database, they function as a single logical table.


How Does Partitioning Work?

1. Declarative Partitioning: PostgreSQL uses declarative partitioning, meaning you can define partitioned tables using SQL commands.
2. Partitioning Methods:
   - Range Partitioning: Tables are divided based on a range of values (e.g., dates or numerical ranges). Useful for time-series data (e.g., partitioning a sales table by year or month).
   - List Partitioning: Tables are split based on a predefined list of values (e.g., partitioning by region).
   - Hash Partitioning: Rows are distributed across partitions using a hash function, useful for even data distribution without specific ranges or lists.


By default, partitions in PostgreSQL are stored on the same physical machine within a single instance.
Partitioning improves performance and scalability within that instance, but it doesn't provide horizontal scaling across multiple machines.
For scaling across nodes, tools like Citus or clustering are needed.


Example SQL Code for Partitioning (Range Partitioning):
    CREATE TABLE sales (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        product_id INT,
        sale_date DATE,
        amount DECIMAL
    ) PARTITION BY RANGE (sale_date);

    CREATE TABLE sales_2020 PARTITION OF sales
        FOR VALUES FROM ('2020-01-01') TO ('2020-12-31');

    CREATE TABLE sales_2021 PARTITION OF sales
        FOR VALUES FROM ('2021-01-01') TO ('2021-12-31');
    """

Functions, Triggers, and Views in PostgreSQL
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Functions:
    - Purpose: Encapsulate reusable logic such as calculations or data manipulation.
    - Features: Can include loops, conditionals, accept parameters, return values.
    - Languages: PL/pgSQL or others.
    - Example: Calculate a discount based on order total.
      CREATE FUNCTION calculate_discount(order_total NUMERIC)
      RETURNS NUMERIC AS $$
      BEGIN
          IF order_total > 100 THEN
              RETURN order_total * 0.1;
          ELSE
              RETURN 0;
          END IF;
      END;
      $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;


Triggers:
    - Purpose: Automatically invoked on INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations.
    - Features: Automates tasks, enforces integrity, logs changes.
    - Example: Log changes to the orders table.
      CREATE FUNCTION log_order_changes()
      RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
      BEGIN
          INSERT INTO audit_log (operation, changed_data, changed_at)
          VALUES ('UPDATE', NEW, NOW());
          RETURN NEW;
      END;
      $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

      CREATE TRIGGER order_update_trigger
      AFTER UPDATE ON orders
      FOR EACH ROW
      EXECUTE FUNCTION log_order_changes();


Views:
    - Purpose: Virtual tables representing predefined SQL queries.
    - Features: Simplifies queries, encapsulates logic, and restricts access.
    - Example: Show recent orders.
      CREATE VIEW recent_orders AS
      SELECT * FROM orders
      WHERE order_date > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';

Materialized Views:
    - Purpose: Stores the result of a query physically.
    - Features: Improves read performance for complex queries.
    - Considerations: Requires manual refresh, incurs storage overhead.


Key Differences:
- Functions: Perform complex operations and return values.
- Triggers: Automatically invoked by table events for integrity and automation.
- Views: Simplify queries but don't store data physically.
- Materialized Views: Store query results for faster reads.

Integration:
- Functions can be invoked by triggers.
- Views can be used in functions and triggers.

Use Cases:
- Functions: For business logic, calculations, and data transformations.
- Triggers: For auditing, enforcing integrity, and automation.
- Views: To simplify queries and restrict data access.
- Materialized Views: To enhance performance for read-heavy queries.

Database Concurrency Control - Locks, Isolation Level, Transactions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Core Concurrency Issues & Anomalies
--------------------------------------
When multiple transactions access and modify the same data concurrently, several problems can arise:

    • Dirty Reads
      A transaction reads data that has been modified by another transaction but not yet committed. If that other transaction rolls back, the first transaction will have used invalid (rolled-back) data.

    • Non-Repeatable Reads
      A transaction reads the same row multiple times within a single transaction but finds the data changed because another transaction updated it between reads.

    • Phantom Reads
      A transaction re-executes a range query (e.g., “WHERE department = 'HR'”) and discovers newly inserted or deleted rows that were not in the initial result set.

    • Lost Updates / Write Skew
      Two transactions read the same data, modify it, and commit in a way that overwrites or invalidates each other’s changes.

    • Deadlocks
      Two or more transactions wait indefinitely for each other’s locks to be released (circular waiting). Databases detect and resolve deadlocks by aborting one of the transactions.


2. Isolation Levels
-------------------
Isolation levels determine how and when changes made by one transaction become visible to others, thereby mitigating concurrency issues.

    • READ UNCOMMITTED
      Allows dirty reads. Minimal locking. Generally not used in production because of potential data inconsistencies.

    • READ COMMITTED (common default)
      Prevents dirty reads by ensuring you only see data that has been committed. Shared locks for reads are typically released after the statement completes, enabling higher concurrency but allowing non-repeatable reads and phantom reads.

    • REPEATABLE READ
      Prevents dirty and non-repeatable reads by holding shared locks until the end of the transaction, ensuring consistent reads of the same rows. Phantom reads may still occur in some systems strictly following the SQL standard, though in PostgreSQL, REPEATABLE READ also helps mitigate phantoms.

    • SERIALIZABLE
      The strictest level. Prevents dirty, non-repeatable, and phantom reads by treating all concurrent transactions as though they occurred in a strictly serial order. This often entails additional locking or transaction rollbacks in the face of conflicts.


3. Locks: The Core Mechanism
----------------------------
Locks are the primary method databases use to enforce isolation. They control concurrent access to data:

    • Shared Locks (S)
      Allow concurrent read access. Multiple transactions can hold shared locks on the same data, but no transaction can modify the locked data until all shared locks are released.

    • Exclusive Locks (X)
      Grant exclusive write access. Only one transaction can hold an exclusive lock on a piece of data at a time, preventing both reads-with-lock (FOR SHARE) and writes by other transactions.

- SELECT ... FOR UPDATE
  Acquires an exclusive row-level lock on selected rows. Blocks other transactions from modifying or locking those rows until the transaction commits or rolls back.

- SELECT ... FOR SHARE
  Acquires a shared lock on selected rows. Prevents modifications (UPDATE/DELETE) but allows other transactions to obtain shared locks as well. Other transactions can still perform plain SELECTs on those rows.

### Lock Granularity
    - Row-Level Lock: Locks individual rows, maximizing concurrency in OLTP systems.
    - Table-Level Lock: Locks an entire table (e.g., TRUNCATE operations).
    - Lightweight Lock (e.g., ACCESS SHARE): A simple table-level lock acquired by a plain SELECT that prevents schema changes (DROP/ALTER), but does not block row-level updates or deletes.


4. Practical Lock Usage & Isolation Interactions
------------------------------------------------
    • Implicit vs. Explicit Locking
      Databases usually handle locking automatically based on the isolation level. However, explicit locks (FOR SHARE or FOR UPDATE) are used when you need to ensure no one else can modify the rows you’ve just read before you finish processing.

    • Plain SELECT
      By default, does not acquire row-level locks. It only acquires a lightweight lock preventing schema changes. It does not stop other transactions from updating or deleting those rows.

    • Lock Duration
      Typically, locks are held until the transaction either commits or rolls back. Under READ COMMITTED, shared locks may be released after each statement; under REPEATABLE READ or SERIALIZABLE, locks generally persist until the entire transaction completes.

    • Performance vs. Consistency
      Higher isolation levels improve data integrity (fewer concurrency anomalies) but can reduce concurrency (more waiting or potential deadlocks). Lower isolation levels maximize concurrency but risk anomalies like non-repeatable or phantom reads.

    • Isolation Per Connection or Transaction
      Isolation levels can be set globally to the database(default), per client session, or per transaction. Different connections can use different isolation levels simultaneously on the same database.

PostgreSQL Processes & Cache – Short Summary
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Process Model
   • Postmaster (main server daemon) starts and manages, listen to port 5432:
     – Backend processes: one per client connection.
     – Background processes: e.g., checkpointer, writer, walwriter, autovacuum, for maintenance routine.
   • Each backend handles queries and coordinates with shared memory.

2. Memory & Cache
   • Shared Buffers (Buffer Cache): Main in-memory region for caching data pages (default 8 KB/page).
   • When a query needs data:
     – The backend checks shared buffers first.
     – If not found, it fetches from disk (possibly via OS cache) and places it in shared buffers.
   • Dirty pages (modified data) are eventually written to disk by background writer or at checkpoints.

3. Key Points
   • shared_buffers size (often ~25% of RAM) is critical for performance.
   • Effective caching and correct tuning reduce disk I/O, speeding up queries.
   • PostgreSQL relies on both its own buffer cache and the OS page cache for optimal performance.

Schema Management Overview
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Normalization
   - **Definition**: Organizing data into logical tables to minimize redundancy and prevent anomalies.
   - **Key Forms**:
         • 1NF (First Normal Form): Atomic columns (no repeating groups).
         • 2NF (Second Normal Form): Full dependency on the primary key (no partial dependencies).
         • 3NF (Third Normal Form): No transitive dependencies among non-key columns.
   - **Benefits**:
         • Simplifies updates and inserts (reduces inconsistency).
         • Clarifies data relationships, fosters data integrity.
   - **Drawbacks**:
         • Highly normalized schemas can increase the number of joins, impacting read performance.

2. Denormalization
   - **Definition**: Intentionally adding redundancy or precomputed data to reduce complex joins and speed up read-heavy operations.
   - **When to Use**:
         • Reporting or analytics where large joins hurt performance.
         • Frequently accessed aggregates or summaries that rarely change.
   - **Trade-Off**:
         • Increased write complexity (must update redundant data).
         • Potential inconsistency if not carefully managed.

3. Relational Constraints
   - **Foreign Keys**: Ensure referential integrity (no orphan records). Usually requires indexing to maintain performance on inserts/updates.
   - **Unique Constraints**: Prevent duplicate values for key attributes (e.g., email). Implemented via unique indexes.
   - **Check Constraints**: Enforce domain-specific rules (e.g., positive salary). Adds slight overhead to inserts/updates.
   - **Cascading Actions**: Useful for automatically deleting or updating related rows; can have performance implications if many child records exist.

Accurate Summary of MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Overview:
MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control) is a mechanism used in databases like PostgreSQL to manage **concurrent reads and writes**
while maintaining data consistency and isolation. Instead of locking rows for reads, MVCC creates **multiple versions of rows**,
allowing transactions to operate independently without interfering with each other.



## Heap Storage in PostgreSQL
    In PostgreSQL, each table is stored as a heap file, which is an unordered collection of pages (typically 8 KB in size) where rows are stored sequentially.
    These rows include metadata required for MVCC, such as transaction IDs (`xmin`, `xmax`).
    Updates to rows create new versions in the heap while leaving the old versions as "dead tuples," and deletes simply mark rows as invalid without immediate removal.
    Over time, dead tuples accumulate, and PostgreSQL's `VACUUM` process reclaims space to prevent table bloat.
    Indexes store pointers (`ctid`) to row locations in the heap but do not dictate the physical order of rows.
    Query results are organized based on execution plans, not the physical storage order, ensuring flexibility and efficiency in data retrieval.


## Key Principles of MVCC:
    1. **Snapshot Isolation**:
       - Each transaction sees a consistent "snapshot" of the database as it existed at the start of the transaction.
       - Readers never block writers, and writers never block readers.

    2. **Row Versioning**:
       - Updates and deletes do not overwrite rows in place. Instead:
         - A new version of the row is created.
         - The old version remains until no active transaction needs it.
       - Each row includes:
         - **xmin**: The transaction ID (XID) that created the row.
         - **xmax**: The XID that invalidated the row (via update/delete).
         - **ctid**: A pointer to the row's physical location in the heap.


## Handling Conflicts:
    1. **Read-Write Conflicts**:
       - Readers never block or get blocked by writers. They simply see the latest valid version of rows as per their snapshot.
    2. **Write-Write Conflicts**:
       - The first transaction to lock and commit updates on a row "wins."
       - Other transactions waiting to update the same row proceed based on the latest committed version.



## Maintenance in MVCC:
    1. **Dead Tuples**:
       - Old row versions (dead tuples) remain in the database until they are cleaned up.
    2. **VACUUM**:
       - PostgreSQL uses `VACUUM` to remove dead tuples and reclaim space, preventing table bloat.


## Advantages:
    - High **concurrency**: Readers and writers operate independently.
    - Non-blocking **reads**: Readers see consistent snapshots without locking.
    - Maintains **data consistency**: Ensures atomicity and isolation.
