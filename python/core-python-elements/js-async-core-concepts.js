// ==========================================================
// Asynchronous Programming in JavaScript
// ==========================================================
// In JavaScript, asynchronous programming is handled through
// callbacks, promises, and async/await. These concepts allow
// JavaScript to perform I/O operations like reading files or
// fetching data without blocking the main thread of execution.

// ==========================================================
// Callbacks in JavaScript
// ==========================================================
// A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function
// and is executed once that function finishes its task. This is the simplest
// form of asynchronous programming in JavaScript.

console.log("Start");

function fetchData(callback) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Data fetched");
        callback("Data received!");
    }, 2000);
}

fetchData((message) => {
    console.log(message);  // This will execute once fetchData finishes.
});

console.log("End");

// Explanation:
// The code first prints "Start".
// fetchData simulates an asynchronous operation with setTimeout and accepts a callback to be called once the data is "fetched."
// The callback logs the message after 2 seconds.


// ==========================================================
// Promises in JavaScript
// ==========================================================
// A Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion
// (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
// Promises allow better handling of asynchronous code compared to callbacks,
// avoiding the problem known as "callback hell."
// every Promise gets an Executor Function to run immediately when the Promise is created.
// the Executor Function get 2 params (resolve, reject) which set the return types of the promise when it completed.

// A Promise can be in one of three states:
// 1. Pending: The initial state, before the operation has completed.
// 2. Resolved: The operation has completed successfully (fulfilled).
// 3. Rejected: The operation has failed.

// Example of using Promises:

console.log("Start");

function fetchData() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            const success = true; // Change to false to simulate failure
            if (success) {
                resolve("Data fetched successfully!");
            } else {
                reject("Data fetch failed.");
            }
        }, 2000);
    });
}

fetchData()
    .then((message) => {
        console.log(message);  // On success
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error(error);  // On failure
    });

console.log("End");

// Explanation:
// The fetchData function returns a Promise.
// The resolve function is called when the asynchronous operation is successful,
// and the reject function is used when it fails.
// then() is used to handle the success case, while catch() handles failures.


// ==========================================================
// Async/Await in JavaScript
// ==========================================================
// async/await is a modern and cleaner way of handling asynchronous code.
// async is used to define a function that returns a Promise, and await
// is used to pause the execution of the function until the Promise is resolved.

// Example of using async/await:

console.log("Start");

async function fetchData() {
    let message = await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            resolve("Data fetched using async/await!");
        }, 2000);
    });
    console.log(message);
}

fetchData();

console.log("End");

// Explanation:
// The fetchData function is asynchronous, and await is used to pause the function until the Promise resolves.
// This makes the code look synchronous while still being asynchronous.



// --------------------------------------- High Performance Examples ------------------------------------------------

// Each Promise waits sequentially, so the total time is the sum of the individual wait times:
// 2 seconds (1st promise) + 2 seconds (snd promise) + 2 seconds (3rd promise) = 6 seconds.
async function fetchData() {
    let message = await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            resolve("Data fetched using async/await!");
        }, 2000);
    });
    console.log(message);

    let message2 = await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            resolve("Data fetched using async/await!");
        }, 2000);
    });
    console.log(message2);

    let message24 = await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            resolve("Data fetched using async/await!");
        }, 2000);
    });
    console.log(message24);
}




// If the Promises are independent and don't rely on each other's resolved values, you can execute them concurrently using
// Promise.all. This will reduce the total wait time to 2 seconds because all Promises start at the same time:

async function fetchData() {
    const [message1, message2, message3] = await Promise.all([
        new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(() => resolve("Data 1 fetched!"), 2000)),
        new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(() => resolve("Data 2 fetched!"), 2000)),
        new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(() => resolve("Data 3 fetched!"), 2000))
    ]);

    console.log(message1);
    console.log(message2);
    console.log(message3);



/*
Why JavaScript Doesn't Require Cooperative Tasks:

Delegation to External APIs:
    In JavaScript, when you initiate an asynchronous operation (e.g., fetch, setTimeout, or file I/O in Node.js):
        The JavaScript engine delegates the operation to the environment's API (like Web APIs or libuv).
        These APIs handle the work (using their own threads, processes, or other mechanisms) outside of the JavaScript runtime.

    Non-blocking Main Thread:
        The JavaScript runtime only "knows about" the operation when the external API signals its completion. This result is placed in the task queue for the event loop to pick up.
        Since the main JavaScript thread is not involved in the actual execution of the operation, it doesnâ€™t block or require yielding.

Comparison with Python asyncio:
    In Python's asyncio, the default event loop does not have access to a pre-configured external system like Web APIs or libuv.
    By default, all tasks are handled in a single thread, requiring tasks to yield control cooperatively via await.
