Broker ID
    Key: broker.id
    Default: 0 (if not explicitly set, it is automatically generated starting from 0).
    Purpose: Identifies a broker in the cluster. Each broker must have a unique broker.id.
    Log Directories

Key: log.dirs
    Default: /tmp/kafka-logs
    Purpose: Directories where Kafka stores log files (partitions and offsets).
    Recommendation: Use different directories for brokers on the same machine.

ZooKeeper Connect
    Key: zookeeper.connect
    Default: None (must be set if using ZooKeeper).
    Purpose: Specifies the ZooKeeper ensemble (e.g., localhost:2181).
    Required: If using ZooKeeper (Kafka 2.8+ can optionally use KRaft).

Default Replication Factor
    Key: default.replication.factor
    Default: 1
    Purpose: Default number of replicas for new topics.

Number of Partitions
    Key: num.partitions
    Default: 1
    Purpose: Default number of partitions for new topics.

Listener and Networking
    Key: listeners
    Default: PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092
    Purpose: Specifies how the broker communicates with clients (broker binds and listen to request from localhost endpoint at port 9092).
    Recommended for multi-broker setup on the same machine: Assign unique ports (e.g., 9092, 9093, 9094).

Advertised Listeners
    Key: advertised.listeners
    Default: None (must be explicitly set when needed).
    Purpose: Specifies the external-facing addresses and ports that Kafka brokers advertise to clients for establishing connections.
    This is essential in multi-node setups, containerized environments, or when Kafka runs behind NAT/firewalls,
    as it provides clients with a reachable address different from the broker's local binding.

    ** listeners: Handles the actual network binding for incoming client connections.
    ** advertised.listeners: Informs clients about where they can find the broker.
    ** The client connects via the advertised address, and the listener handles the connection on the broker side.

Log Retention
    Key: log.retention.hours
    Default: 168 (7 days)
    Purpose: Time to retain log segments before deletion.
